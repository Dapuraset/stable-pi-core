## Overview

The Quantum and AI Arbitration Project aims to leverage cutting-edge technologies to enhance decision-making processes in arbitration. By combining quantum algorithms with machine learning models, the project seeks to improve efficiency, accuracy, and security in arbitration scenarios.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow the instructions in the [User Guide](user_guide.md).

## Components

The project consists of several key components:

- **Quantum Solver**: Implements quantum algorithms for optimization.
- **Predictive Model**: Uses machine learning to predict outcomes based on historical data.
- **Fraud Detection**: Identifies potential fraud in transaction data.
- **Risk Assessment**: Evaluates the risk associated with arbitration cases.
- **Arbitration Service**: Integrates all components to process arbitration cases.

## Usage
