## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KOSASIH/stable-pi-core.git
   cd quantum-ai-arbitration
   ```

2. **Run the Setup Script**
   The setup script will install all the required packages for the project.
   ```bash
   python scripts/setup.py
   ```

## Running the Setup Script

The setup script installs the necessary dependencies for the project. It will install packages such as `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `qiskit`, and others.

To run the setup script, execute the following command in your terminal:
```bash
python scripts/setup.py
```

## Running Simulations

After setting up the environment, you can run quantum simulations using the provided script.

1. **Run the Simulation Script**
   This script will execute a quantum optimization problem.
   ```bash
   python scripts/run_simulation.py
   ```

2. **View the Results**
   The results of the simulation will be logged in the console, showing the optimal solution and its value.

## Using the API

You can use the API to interact with the various components of the project. Below are examples of how to use the key classes.

### Example: Using the Quantum Solver

```python
from quantum.quantum_solver import QuantumSolver

# Initialize the quantum solver
solver = QuantumSolver(backend='qasm_simulator', shots=1024)

# Define a sample optimization problem
problem = [100, 200, 300]

# Solve the optimization problem
result = solver.solve_optimization(problem)
print("Optimization Result:", result)
```

### Example: Using the Predictive Model

```python
from ai.predictive_model import PredictiveModel

# Initialize the predictive model
model = PredictiveModel(model_path='./models/predictive_model.pkl')

# Train the model with sample data
data = {
    'feature1': [1, 2, 3, 4],
    'feature2': [4, 5, 6, 7],
    'target': [0, 1, 0, 1]
}
model.train(data)

# Predict the outcome
prediction = model.predict_outcome({'feature1': 3, 'feature2': 6})
print("Predicted Outcome:", prediction)
```

### Example: Using the Fraud Detection

```python
from ai.fraud_detection import FraudDetection

# Initialize the fraud detection model
fraud_detector = FraudDetection(model_path='./models/fraud_detection_model.pkl')

# Train the model with sample data
data = {
    'feature1': [1, 2, 3, 4],
    'feature2': [4, 5, 6, 7],
    'is_fraud': [0, 1, 0, 1]
}
fraud_detector.train(data)

# Detect fraud
result = fraud_detector.detect_fraud({'feature1': 2, 'feature2': 5})
print("Fraud Detection Result:", result)
```

## Example Use Cases

1. **Arbitration Case Processing**
   You can process an arbitration case by integrating all components through the `ArbitrationService`.

   ```python
   from arbitration.arbitration_service import ArbitrationService
   from quantum.quantum_solver import QuantumSolver
   from ai.predictive_model import PredictiveModel
   from ai.fraud_detection import FraudDetection
   from arbitration.risk_assessment import RiskAssessment

   # Initialize components
   quantum_solver = QuantumSolver()
   predictive_model = PredictiveModel()
   fraud_detection = FraudDetection()
   risk_assessment = RiskAssessment()

   arbitration_service = ArbitrationService(
       quantum_solver,
       predictive_model,
       fraud_detection,
       risk_assessment
   )

   # Example raw data for processing
   case_data = {
       'transaction_data': {'feature1': 2, 'feature2': 5},
       'historical_data': {'feature1': [1, 2, 3], 'feature2': [4, 5, 6]}
   }

   # Process the arbitration case
   results = arbitration_service.process_case(case_data)
   print("Arbitration Case Results:", results)
   ```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues while setting up or running the project, consider the following steps:

- Ensure all dependencies are installed correctly.
- Check the compatibility of your Python version.
- Review the console logs for any error messages and consult the documentation for guidance.

## Conclusion

This user guide provides a comprehensive overview of how to set up and utilize the Quantum and AI Arbitration Project. For further assistance or advanced usage, refer to the API reference or reach out to the project maintainers. Happy coding!
