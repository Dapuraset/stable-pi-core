## Understanding the Dual Value System

The Dual Value System allows Pi Coin to maintain two distinct values:

- **Stable Value**: This is a fixed value that Pi Coin is pegged to, ensuring stability in transactions and holdings.
- **Market-Driven Value**: This value fluctuates based on market conditions, allowing users to take advantage of price movements.

This system provides flexibility for users, enabling them to choose between stability and potential growth.

## Getting Started

To begin using the Dual Value System, you need to have the following:

- A registered account on the Stable Pi Core platform.
- Access to the API endpoints provided by the Stable Pi Core application.

## Using the Dual Value System

### Converting Between Values

You can convert between the stable value and the market-driven value using the following API endpoint:

### POST `/api/dual-value/convert`

**Request Body:**

```json
{
    "amount": 10,
    "fromValueType": "stable", // or "market"
    "toValueType": "market" // or "stable"
}
```

**Response:**

- **200 OK**: Returns the converted amount.
- **400 Bad Request**: If the request is invalid.
- **500 Internal Server Error**: If there is an error during conversion.

### Example Request

Using cURL:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/dual-value/convert \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
    "amount": 10,
    "fromValueType": "stable",
    "toValueType": "market"
}'
```

## API Endpoints

Here is a summary of the key API endpoints for the Dual Value System:

| Method | Endpoint                        | Description                          |
|--------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| POST   | `/api/dual-value/convert`      | Convert between stable and market-driven values |

## Example Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Converting Stable Value to Market Value

If you have 10 Pi Coins at a stable value and want to convert them to their market-driven equivalent, you would send a request to the `/convert` endpoint as shown above.

### Use Case 2: Converting Market Value to Stable Value

If you have 5 Pi Coins at the market-driven value and want to convert them to the stable value, you would adjust the request accordingly:

```json
{
    "amount": 5,
    "fromValueType": "market",
    "toValueType": "stable"
}
```

## Error Handling

When working with the API, it's essential to handle errors gracefully. Here are some common error responses you might encounter:

- **400 Bad Request**: The request was invalid. Check the request body and parameters.
- **404 Not Found**: The requested resource could not be found.
- **500 Internal Server Error**: An unexpected error occurred on the server.

### Example Error Handling

When making API requests, you should implement error handling in your application. Hereâ€™s an example in JavaScript:

```javascript
fetch('http://localhost:3000/api/dual-value/convert', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
        amount: 10,
        fromValueType: "stable",
        toValueType: "market"
    })
})
.then(response => {
    if (!response.ok) {
        throw new Error(`HTTP error! status: ${response.status}`);
    }
    return response.json();
})
.then(data => console.log(data))
.catch(error => console.error('Error:', error));
```

## Best Practices

To ensure a smooth experience while using the Dual Value System, consider the following best practices:

- **Keep Your API Keys Secure**: Never expose your API keys in public repositories or client-side code.
- **Validate Input Data**: Always validate the data sent to the API to prevent errors and ensure data integrity.
- **Monitor API Usage**: Keep track of your API usage to avoid hitting rate limits and to optimize performance.
- **Implement Logging**: Use logging to track API requests and responses for debugging and monitoring purposes.

## Conclusion
