# Wormhole Data Bridge (WDB)

The Wormhole Data Bridge (WDB) is a blockchain-based system designed to facilitate secure and efficient data transfer, governance, and predictive analytics. It leverages smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain to manage a stablecoin and governance proposals, enabling decentralized decision-making and financial transactions.

## Features

- **Token Minting and Burning**: Create and destroy tokens as needed.
- **Governance Proposals**: Create, vote on, and execute proposals for decentralized governance.
- **Data Prediction**: Predict future data needs based on historical data.
- **Quantum Entanglement Simulation**: Simulate quantum entanglement for data security.
- **Node Management**: Manage nodes in the network and retrieve their locations.
